# A Backdoor Locksmith

This tool is a rewrite of my [backdoor lockpick](https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/backdoor-lockpick) for backdoors
on Phicomm routers. For details on the Phicomm backdoors, including an analysis and reconstructed history of the
Phicomm backdoor protocol, and analysis of (what was at the time of discovery) a 0-day vulnerability in every 
iteration of the Phicomm backdoor, see [my writeup on the Tenable Techblog](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/a-backdoor-lockpick-d847a83f4496) or my [talk at REcon Montreal, 2023](https://cfp.recon.cx/2023/talk/JBQEMS/), the slides for which can be found in the `slides/` directory.
